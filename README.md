pico4u-vr-sleep-workaround is a workaround tool designed to prevent the Pico 4 Ultra VR headset from going to sleep during development or specific use cases. It operates by periodically sending a keep-alive signal via ADB.

[日本語版（Japanese Version）はこちら](.github/README_ja.md)

## 🌟 Features

- **Keep-Alive Signal**: Prevents the headset from entering sleep mode by sending the `keyevent 224` (wake up) command at a configurable interval (default: 3 seconds).
- **Wireless Debug first**: USB is used only once to enable ADB over Wi-Fi (`adb tcpip 5555`). After that the app keeps watching the saved IP and reconnects automatically.
- **Live status**: A single screen shows whether the headset is ready (port 5555 reachable and ADB connected), the USB connection state, and activity / setup logs.
- **Auto-Dimming**: Optionally dims the headset's screen brightness to the lowest level (`1`) after a configurable delay (in hours) to prevent screen burn-in and save power.
- **Multi-language Support**: User Interface is available in English and Japanese.

## 🔧 Prerequisites: Enable USB Debugging

Before using the tool, you must enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging on your Pico 4 Ultra:
1. On your headset, go to **Settings > General > About**.
2. Click **Software Version** 7 times to enable Developer Mode.
3. Go back to **Settings > Developer** and toggle **USB Debugging** to ON.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

1. Download the latest release for your platform (Windows `nsis` / `msi` installers are provided).
2. Install and launch the application.
3. Connect your Pico 4 Ultra via USB (if a USB debugging prompt appears in the headset, select "Always allow").
4. Open **Wireless Debug setup** and click **Enable Wireless Debug**. When it finishes, unplug the cable.
5. Once the status shows **Ready**, click **Start sleep prevention**.

Wireless Debug turns off when the headset restarts; repeat steps 3–4 in that case.
